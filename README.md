# Encrypter-Decrypter
 A text Encryption-Decryption project leveraging four distinct algorithms to secure data, processed from .txt files. Implemented via socket programming.

The project aims to create a secure communication system using Python socket programming, enabling multiple clients to exchange encrypted messages or files with a server. Various encryption algorithms such as Playfair Cipher, RSA, ECC, and AES are implemented, alongside features like SSL for secure communication, file upload capability, and authentication using Flask UI and SQLAlchemy database.


STEPS TO EXECUTE:
1)Run the App.py program and choose one of the two web adresses and follow the link.
2)Sign Up in the Authentication page and  login.
3)Can either enter the text manually or upload a .txt file for encryption and decryption.
4)Choose which algorithm to be used for encryption/decryption and choose encrypt/decrypt respectively.
5)For RSA and ECC the encrypted text is given directly.
6)For Playfair and AES you need to enter a key in the terminal
(Playfair-One word key of maximum length 25 letters)
(AES-A 16 bit key numbers or letters without spaces)
7)For Decryption using Playfair andd AES the same key used while encryption should be used.
